## Description

AS A developer who writes about tech
I WANT a CMS-style blog site
SO THAT I can publish articles, blog posts, and my thoughts and opinions
I LEARNED how to utilize handlebars.js and the Model View Controller Model to create a full stack app.
I ALSO LEARNED that I hate handlebars.js with the burning rage of 1000 suns, 3rd to only spiders and beans.

## Installation
The site can be accessed on heroku at the link under the title,
If you want to download this project be sure to install dependanices with `npm i`
Then run node server.js and go to http://localhost:3001
Make an account, your password should be 4 or greater characters

## Usage
CLicking the big "Tech Blog" in the top left corner will always bring you back to the homepage
Once signed up and logged in you can create posts, view recent posts, and comment on posts.
If you view the posts you made from your dashboard you can update and delete your posts
